Creating a database
-------------------

To create a database, execute the following command:

~~~~ sh
createdb -E utf8 -T postgres hackerspub
~~~~

This command creates a database named `hackerspub`.  You can use a different
name if you want.


Configuration
-------------

The project uses environment variables for configuration. You can see the list
of all available variables in the *.env.sample* file.  Copy this file to *.env*
and set the values of the variables according to your environment.

> [!TIP]
> Here are some tips for setting up the environment variables for your local
> development:
>
>  -  Even if you are setting up a local development environment, you should
>     set `ORIGIN` to the URL where the server will be hosted, which is
>     accessible from the public internet.  This is required for the ActivityPub
>     federation to work.  See also the section on [*Setting up
>     federation*](#setting-up-federation).
>
>  -  `SECRET_KEY` is a random string that is used for encrypting the session
>     data.  You can generate a new key using the following command:
>
>     ~~~~ sh
>     openssl rand -hex 32
>     ~~~~
>
>  -  `INSTANCE_ACTOR_KEY` is a RSA private key with JWK format.  You can
>     generate a new key using the following command:
>
>     ~~~~ sh
>     mise run keygen
>     ~~~~
>
>     Warn that you should quote the key value with single quotes in the *.env*
>     file, e.g., `INSTANCE_ACTOR_KEY='{"kty":"RSA",...}'`.
>
>  -  `KV_URL` can start with `file://` to use a file-based cache, e.g.,
>     `KV_URL=file:///tmp/kv.db`.
>
>  -  `DRIVE_DISK` can be set to `fs` to use the file system for storing files.
>
>     In this case, you also need to set `FS_LOCATION` to the directory where
>     the files will be stored, which can be a relative path to the project
>     directory, e.g., `FS_LOCATION=./media`.
>
>     For your information, the *media/* directory under the project directory
>     is listed in the *.gitignore* file, so you don't need to worry about
>     accidentally committing the files to the repository.
>
>  -  `MAILGUN_API_KEY` is the API key for sending emails.  You can use a
>     [Mailgun] account for this.  However, if you won't test sending emails
>     (e.g., for sign up or sending invitations), you can omit this variable.
>
>  -  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` are the API keys
>     for summarizing and translating posts using LLMs.  You can use
>     [Anthropic] and [Google Generative AI] accounts for this.  However, if
>     you won't test these features, you can omit these variables.
>
>  -  `FUTURE_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE` is the tolerance period in milliseconds for
>     posts with future timestamps. Posts published more than this time in the
>     future will be filtered out from timelines. Default value is 300000 (5
>     minutes). This helps prevent malicious or misconfigured remote servers
>     from disrupting timeline order with posts that have future timestamps.


Creating a database schema
--------------------------

Before running the server, you need to create the database schema.  To do this,
you need to run the database migrations:

~~~~ sh
mise run migrate
~~~~


Creating the first account
--------------------------

To create the first account, you need to run the following command:

~~~~ sh
mise run addaccount your@email.com
~~~~

This command creates a sign up token for the first account.  You can use any
email address you want.  The command will print a link to the console.
You can use this link to sign up for the first account after running the server.


Running the server
------------------

To run the server, execute the following command:

~~~~ sh
mise run dev:web
~~~~

This command starts the server on port 8000.


Setting up federation
---------------------

Since Hackers' Pub is a federated platform through ActivityPub, you would need
to set up federation to test how your changes affect the federation.  To do
this, you need to place your local server behind a reverse proxy that supports
tunneling.

There are quite [many options available][1], but we recommend using [ngrok]
for one-time contributions.

> [!TIP]
> If you are a regular contributor, you may want to use a more permanent
> solution, such as [Tailscale Funnel] or [Cloudflare Tunnel].

 1. Configure `BEHIND_PROXY=true` in the *.env* file.

 2. Create an account on [ngrok].

 3. [Install `ngrok` and connect your account.][2]

 4. Start the tunnel by executing the following command (ensuring your local
    server is running on port 8000):

    ~~~~ sh
    ngrok http 8000
    ~~~~

 5. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by `ngrok`, and put it in the `ORIGIN`
    environment variable in the *.env* file.

 6. Restart the server, and you are ready to test federation.

When testing federation, you must use the HTTPS URL provided by `ngrok` as the
base URL for your local server.  This is because ActivityPub requires
the server to be accessible over HTTPS.

Running web-next
----------------

To run web-next, the new web frontend for Hackers' Pub, follow these steps:

 1. Navigate to the *web-next/* directory.

 2. Optionally install [watchman].  If watchman is available, the Relay
    compiler runs automatically as part of the Vite dev server via
    [vite-plugin-relay-lite].  If watchman is not installed, set the
    `NO_WATCHMAN=1` environment variable when running the dev server and
    run `pnpm codegen` manually whenever GraphQL files change.

 3. Run the development server with the command
    `API_URL=http://localhost:8000/graphql mise run dev:web-next`.
    The legacy server must be running at this point, as it also serves as
    the GraphQL API server for web-next.

 4. Access http://localhost:3000/ to see the new look of Hackers' Pub.

When you build new UI in *web-next/*, follow the conventions documented in
[*DESIGN.md*](./DESIGN.md) — it covers the color tokens, typography, component
patterns (solid-ui in the New York style), and brand asset usage.

Setting up Visual Studio Code
-----------------------------

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code] for development.  To set up Visual
Studio Code for this project, follow these steps:

 1. Run `code` in the project directory to open the project in Visual Studio
    Code.
 2. Trust the workspace by clicking the <q>Trust the authors of all files in the
    workspace</q> button when prompted.
 3. Install the recommended extensions when prompted.

That's it!  You are now ready to start coding.

Want other tools?
-----------------

If you are a passionate user of other tools, such as Vim or Emacs, you need to
manually set up the project for those tools.  We recommend following the [Deno's
official guide for setting up your favorite editor][3].

Running tests
-------------

Currently, we don't have many tests.  However, we encourage you to write tests
for your changes.  To run the tests, execute the following command:

~~~~ sh
deno task test
~~~~


Before submitting a pull request
--------------------------------

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes pass the tests and
that you have formatted the code using `deno fmt`.  You can use the following
command to check the code formatting and run lint checks:

~~~~ sh
deno task check
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> Or, you can use the following command to install a *pre-commit* hook that
> checks the code formatting and runs lint checks before committing:
>
> ~~~~ sh
> deno task hooks:install
> ~~~~
